# CSE215: Foundations of Computer Science (State University of New York, Korea, 2024 Fall)

# Course overview

This course is presented by the Computer Science Department at SUNY Korea. It is about discrete mathematics, a fundamental branch essential for a deep understanding of computer science. Topics covered include propositional and predicate logic, number theory, proof techniques, sequences, recursion, functions, relations, and sets.

The course materials, available in this public repository, will be added to over the course of the semester. We'll be adapting materials previously used at SUNY Korea and Stony Brook University for our curriculum.




# Course objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to have:

- The skill to create truth tables for diverse applications, such as verifying the validity of an argument or determining the equivalence of two propositions.
- The preliminary capability to reason with precision and prove certain theorems.
- A basic understanding of mathematical concepts like sequences, functions, and relations.

# Numerical Grades

-   Homeworks: 30%
-   Midterm1: 20%
-   Midterm2: 20%
-   Final: 30%
-   Students who consistently participate or provide constructive feedback will receive a bonus of  0.5 or 1. Students with three or more class absences will not be eligible for this bonus.

Namely, the numerical grade for the course will be calculated as:

```
def numerical_grade(Homework, Midterm1, Midterm2, Final, Bonus):
    return 0.30 * Homework + 0.20 * Midterm1 + 0.20 * Midterm2 + 0.30 * Final + Bonus
```


Assignments submitted after the deadline are typically not acceptable. Should you have a valid reason for a late submission, it is essential to communicate with the course instructor promptly, providing all necessary supporting documents. Please note, once solutions to the homework exercises have been disclosed, no submissions can be accepted under any circumstances.




# Letter Grades

Absolute grading will be applied:

- **A:** [93, 100] 
- **A-:** [90, 93)
- **B+:** [87, 90)
- **B:** [83, 87)
- **B-:** [80, 83)
- **C+:** [77, 80)
- **C:** [73, 77)
- **C-:** [70, 73)
- **D+:** [67, 70)
- **D:** [63, 67)
- **F:** [0, 63)

# Disability Support Services (DSS) Statement

If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may impact your course work, please contact  One-Stop Service Center, Academic Building A201, (82) 32-626-1117. They will determine with you what accommodations, if any, are necessary and appropriate. All information and documentation is confidential.

Students who require assistance during emergency evacuation are encouraged to discuss their needs with instructors and the One-Stop Service Center.




# Academic integrity

Each student must pursue his or her academic goals honestly and be personally accountable for all submitted work. Representing another person's work as your own is always wrong. Faculty members are required to report any suspected instances of academic dishonesty to the Academic Judiciary Committee or the Department of Academic Affairs, Campus Building A, Room 201, (032) 626-1121.



# Critical incident management

SUNY Korea expects students to respect the rights,
privileges, and property of other people. Faculty are required to report to the Department of Academic Affairs any disruptive behavior that interrupts their ability to teach, compromises the safety of the learning environment, or inhibits students' ability to learn.
